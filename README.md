# Cosine-Similarity-Calculaitons
Cosine similariy is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
This similarity measurement is particularly concerned with orientation, rather than magnitude. This notebook uses cosine similarity to compare both a numeric data within a plane and a text dataset for string matching.
